[NAIT Course Building Tools](https://github.com/SDEV-NAIT/nait-slide-builder)
A set of tools to build content, contains:
- A slide builder to create NAIT standard slides for presentations from markdown files
- A workbook builder to create workbooks for students (for each semester)
- A lesson plan builder to create word lesson plans (required for development) from yml files.

*Note if you want to edit this file please clone the [organization repo](https://github.com/SDEV-NAIT/.github) and edit the `profile/README.md` file. This is the file that displays the information you're reading right now.*

## Course Organizations and Primary Repositories

- Course organizations should have the format **NAIT-SDEVxxxx** (where **xxxx** is the course number) Please contact Nathan Humphrey to create them.
- If you don't have a primary repository for your course yet please contact Daniel Mouris, who will create it for you.

### What should be in the course organization vs here?
- **Course organization**: Assignment templates (anything for github classroom), semester example repos/workbooks, and student assignments. Essentially anything that students need to see or use.
- **This organization**: Course Development, resources (the github "primary course repo" see [contributor guide](https://github.com/SDEV-NAIT/class-instructor-contributor-guide)), solutions. Essentialy anything that is only for instructors or contributors to the course.
